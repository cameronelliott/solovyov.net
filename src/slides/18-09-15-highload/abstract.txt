Make it fast

Any project passes “we need more features” and “omg why is everything so slow”
phases during itslife. They intertwine, they are not always pronounced, but they
are there. Weirdly enough Kasta gets phase #2 regularly; few times a year. Some
of the iterations are especially remarkable. This story is going to tell you how
we quickly (heh) discover them and, for the lack of a better word - solve them.
