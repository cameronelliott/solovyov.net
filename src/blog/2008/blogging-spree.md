That's my first post in this blog. The idea of having blog in English arose a lot of time ago but I always had some lame excuses for myself to not do that. But two weeks ago I've added `ForeignKey` to `Site` to `blog.Post` model in [Byteflow][1] (which naturally reflects my posts in blog ;-)) along with `DynamicSiteMiddleware` and that allows me to simultaneously have two blogs on different domain serving by single Byteflow instance, what, I think, is rather cool. :D

So... welcome to exhaust of my blogging spree, hope you will enjoy it! ;-)
